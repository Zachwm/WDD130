        <p class="about">
            I was born and raised in Spring, Texas which is north of Houston. I am the 
            youngest of seven with two older sisters and four older brothers. Some 
            of my hobbies are playing the guitar, mountain biking, as well as gaming.
            I've always been interested in computers, in high school I built my own!
            I am happily persuing a computer science degree at BYU Idaho currently in
            my freshman year.
