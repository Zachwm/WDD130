                Since i am only a freshmen i am still building this page and 
                will be able to fill it with much more as a get further through 
                my education. On this page though are projects that I am 
                working on or have done in the past. I would also like to
                include that i built this entire website on my own.

                    I am helping to form the International Tech Society which is 
                    a society which helps internation students to be more integrated 
                    with the CSEE department at BYUI.

                    This is a small project i had on my intro programming 
                    class to create a program that takes inputs such as 
                    temperature and windpseed and outputs the temperature 
                    based on your imputs

                    Another great achievement is my creation of this website. 
                    I created the wireframe, html, and css all on my own for
                    this website.
