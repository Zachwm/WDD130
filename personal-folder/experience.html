                Since i am only a freshmen i am still building this page and 
                will be able to fill it with much more as a get further through 
                my education. On this page though are projects that I am 
                working on or have done in the past. I would also like to
                include that i built this entire website on my own.

                    I am helping to form the International Tech Society which 
                    is a society that helps international students to be more 
                    integrated with the CSEE department at BYUI.

                    This is a shopping cart function I created using python 
                    allowing users to add or remove items and their prices 
                    to a shopping cart along with viewing prices and setting 
                    a budget.

                    Another great achievement is my creation of this website. 
                    I created the wireframe, HTML, and CSS all on my own for 
                    this website.
